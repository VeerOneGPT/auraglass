### 🌓 Automatic Text Contrast (NEW!)
To guarantee readable text on dynamic/gradient backgrounds without inline styles, AuraGlass now supports automatic contrast for text tokens:

- Attribute-based tokens:
  - Set `data-bg="dark"` to force light text tokens inside a container.
  - Set `data-bg="light"` to force dark text tokens inside a container.

- Auto-detection hook:
```tsx
import useAutoTextContrast from '@/hooks/useAutoTextContrast';

function Hero() {
  const ref = useRef<HTMLDivElement>(null);
  useAutoTextContrast(ref, { threshold: 0.55, observe: true });
  return (
    <section ref={ref} className="glass-radius-2xl">
      <h1 className="glass-text-primary">Readable on any gradient</h1>
      <p className="glass-text-secondary">Tokens flip automatically.</p>
    </section>
  );
}
```

This flips `--glass-text-primary/secondary` based on backdrop luminance (white-on-dark, black-on-light) while remaining 100% token-driven and lint-compliant (no JSX style attrs).
