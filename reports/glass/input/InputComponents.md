### 📊 DETAILED FINDINGS

#### ✅ APPLIED FIXES ACROSS ALL INPUT COMPONENTS

1. **Unified Glass Foundation:**
   - All components now use `glass-foundation-complete`
   - Consistent backdrop-filter: `blur(16px) saturate(180%) brightness(1.15) contrast(1.08)`
   - Standardized opacity thresholds (≥ 0.22)

2. **Typography Improvements:**
   - Placeholder text: `text-white/70` (was `text-white/60`)
   - Input values: `text-white/95` (maintained)
   - Labels: `text-white/90` (maintained)
   - Helper text: `text-white/75` (maintained)

3. **Opacity Enhancements:**
   - Background: `bg-white/10` → `bg-white/25`
   - Background: `bg-white/15` → `bg-white/25`
   - Background: `bg-white/20` → `bg-white/30`
   - Hover states: `hover:bg-white/10` → `hover:bg-white/25`

4. **Focus State Improvements:**
   - Focus backgrounds: `focus:bg-white/15` → `focus:bg-white/30`
   - Focus backgrounds: `focus:bg-white/10` → `focus:bg-white/25`
   - Enhanced focus rings and borders

5. **Glass Class Standardization:**
   - Replaced `glass-base backdrop-blur-md` → `glass-foundation-complete`
