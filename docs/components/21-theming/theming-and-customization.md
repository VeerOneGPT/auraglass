## Theming and Customization

All AuraGlass components support extensive customization through the `OptimizedGlass` primitive. You can customize:

- **Colors**: Background variants, tints, and color schemes
- **Effects**: Blur intensity, lighting, refraction, caustics
- **Animations**: Hover effects, transitions, micro-interactions
- **Performance**: Lazy loading, performance modes, adaptive effects

For advanced customization, you can create your own component variants by wrapping existing components with custom `OptimizedGlass` configurations.
