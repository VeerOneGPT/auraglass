### 2. GlassMorphingEngine

Environmental adaptation that changes glass properties based on context:

```tsx
import { GlassMorphingEngine } from '@/components/effects/GlassMorphingEngine';

// Automatic environmental adaptation
<GlassMorphingEngine
  environmentalAdaptation
  timeOfDayAdaptation
  weatherAdaptation
  seasonAdaptation
  userActivityAdaptation
>
  <YourContent />
</GlassMorphingEngine>

// Manual environmental override
<GlassMorphingEngine
  environment={{
    weather: 'rainy',
    timeOfDay: 'dusk',
    season: 'winter',
    userActivity: 'focused'
  }}
  intensity={1.8}
  morphingSpeed={0.8}
>
  <YourContent />
</GlassMorphingEngine>
```

**Environmental Factors**:
- Time of day adaptation (dawn, morning, noon, evening, dusk, night)
- Weather responsiveness (sunny, rainy, cloudy, stormy, snowy)
- Seasonal changes (spring, summer, fall, winter)
- User activity detection (active, idle, focused, stressed)
